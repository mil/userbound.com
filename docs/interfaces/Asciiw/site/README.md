==========
Your handcrafted ascii weather report.  A minimalist weather site showing the current weather text info along with some nice ascii animations.

Background: This hack started at mhacks 2013, originally dubbed weatherhack. Used the Wunderground API in attempts to win $500, I didn't. This is cool as shit anyway though.


ASCII Animations, Improvements, and Bugs
----------------------------------------
All ASCII animations were done by hand by me. I'm open to getting some different ASCII animations posted up.

Also send over any recommendations about the functionality of the site.  Any bugs? 

Fork & Pull routine welcomed.
